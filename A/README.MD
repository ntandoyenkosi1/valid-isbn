## Code

```
class Solution:
       def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
      result = {}
      for i in strs:
         x = "".join(sorted())
         if x in result:
            result[x].append(i)
         else:
            result[x] = [i]
      return list(result.values())
ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))
```

### Correctness

-   There are some **syntax errors** in the code mainly due to indentation. It would be better if you pay attention to indentation since this is a python program and it uses indentation to define code blocks.
-   There is a also minor logical error. The sorted function is missing an object that can be iterated through so that it can be sorted. In this case the object would be x.

### Efficiency

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of items to group. This is efficient.

### Style

**Coding style:** The overall coding style is good (assuming indentation is done correct as mentioned before). It might be worthwhile looking into using shorthand notation for if statements such as ternary operator where it's possible.

### Documentation

**Comments:** There are no comments in the solution file and tests accompanying the code. The comments are very good at helping a person viewing your code understand what is happening.
**Variable naming:** It would be useful to use variable names that are more descriptive and specific to this code context.
